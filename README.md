- **Expo Go** app on your mobile device (for testing)

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd thryftclub
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory (if not already present):

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
EXPO_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL=your_solana_rpc_url
```

### 4. Start Development Server

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

This will start the Expo development server and open the Metro bundler in your browser.

## üì± Running the App

### Local Development

1. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Choose your platform**:

   - **iOS Simulator**: Press `i` in the terminal or click "Run on iOS simulator"
   - **Android Emulator**: Press `a` in the terminal or click "Run on Android device/emulator"
   - **Web Browser**: Press `w` in the terminal or click "Run in web browser"
   - **Physical Device**: Scan the QR code with Expo Go app

3. **Development Options**:
   - **Hot Reload**: Changes automatically reflect in the app
   - **Debug Menu**: Shake device or press `Cmd+D` (iOS) / `Cmd+M` (Android)
   - **Developer Tools**: Access React Native Debugger and performance tools

### üì± Testing with Expo Go App

#### Prerequisites for Mobile Testing

- **Expo Go App**: Download from [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779) (iOS) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) (Android)
- **Same Network**: Your mobile device and development machine must be on the same Wi-Fi network
- **Firewall Settings**: Ensure your firewall allows connections on the Expo development port (usually 8081)

#### Step-by-Step Mobile Testing

1. **Start the Development Server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

2. **Access the QR Code**:

   - The Metro bundler will open in your browser showing a QR code
   - The QR code will also be displayed in your terminal

3. **Scan the QR Code**:

   - **iOS**: Open Camera app and point it at the QR code, then tap the notification
   - **Android**: Open Expo Go app and use the "Scan QR Code" option
   - **Alternative**: Open Expo Go app and manually enter the URL shown in the terminal

4. **App Loading**:
   - Expo Go will download and load your app
   - First load may take 1-2 minutes depending on your internet speed
   - Subsequent loads will be faster due to caching

#### Troubleshooting Mobile Testing

**If the QR code doesn't work:**

```bash
# Try using tunnel mode for better connectivity
npm start -- --tunnel
# or
yarn start --tunnel
```

**If you get connection errors:**

- Ensure both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network
- Try switching between "LAN" and "Tunnel" modes in the Expo CLI
- Check if your firewall is blocking the connection

**If the app doesn't load:**

- Clear Expo Go app cache: Settings ‚Üí Clear Cache
- Restart the development server: `Ctrl+C` then `npm start`
- Check the terminal for any error messages

#### Development Features on Mobile

**Hot Reload**:

- Changes to your code automatically reflect in the app
- No need to manually reload or restart

**Debug Menu** (Access by shaking your device):

- **Reload**: Manually reload the app
- **Debug Remote JS**: Open React Native Debugger
- **Show Perf Monitor**: Display performance metrics
- **Settings**: Configure development options

**Console Logs**:

- View console logs in the Expo CLI terminal
- Use `console.log()` statements for debugging

#### Testing Different Scenarios

**Network Testing**:

- Test app behavior with slow internet connections
- Test offline functionality (if implemented)

**Device Testing**:

- Test on different screen sizes and orientations
- Test with different device capabilities (camera, location, etc.)

**Performance Testing**:

- Monitor app performance on actual devices
- Test memory usage and battery consumption

#### Best Practices for Mobile Testing

1. **Regular Testing**: Test on both iOS and Android devices regularly
2. **Real Device Testing**: Always test on physical devices, not just simulators
3. **Network Conditions**: Test with different network speeds and conditions
4. **User Scenarios**: Test complete user journeys from start to finish
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Keep an eye on app performance and loading times
